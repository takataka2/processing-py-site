<description><![CDATA[
The <b>mousePressed()</b> function is called once after every time a mouse button is pressed. The <b>mouseButton</b> variable (see the related reference entry) can be used to determine which button has been pressed.
<br/><br/>
Mouse and keyboard events only work when a program has <b>draw()</b>. Without <b>draw()</b>, the code is only run once and then stops listening for events.

<p>Most of the material online about Processing.py is oriented to Python Mode,
which allows you to write Processing sketches in the PDE using the Python
programming language. But Processing.py also provides a way for you to write
and launch sketches from the command line.</p>

<p>Why use the command line? The PDE is great, of course, and many people use
it for writing interactive applications from sketch to finished product. But
there are some scenarios in which you might want to use the command line: for
easier integration with collaborative version control tools; for more control
over how your application gets packaged; for easier interoperability with other tools that
live on the command-line; etc. Or maybe (like me) you just prefer working on
the command line to working in a GUI. Whatever your reason, this tutorial will
show you how to get up and running.</p>

<p>These instructions are tested on OSX El Capitan, but should work on other
platforms as well.</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>

<p>In order to run Processing.py from the command line, you'll need to <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">install
    the Java JRE</a>. Ensure that you can run Java by typing the following on
the command line:</p>

<pre><code>$ java -version</code></pre>

<p>You should see some output that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>java version "1.8.0_92"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_92-b14)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.92-b14, mixed mode)</code></pre>

<p>You'll also need to obtain the standalone version of Processing.py. Choose
the appropriate link according to your platform:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://py.processing.org/processing.py-macosx.tgz">Mac OS X</a></li>
<li>Windows: <a href="http://py.processing.org/processing.py-windows64.zip">64-bit</a>, <a href="http://py.processing.org/processing.py-windows32.zip">32-bit</a></li>
<li>Linux: <a href="http://py.processing.org/processing.py-linux64.tgz">64-bit</a> <a href="http://py.processing.org/processing.py-linux32.tgz">32-bit</a></li>
</ul>

<p>These files contain the Processing.py JAR file along with some example
scripts and some utility programs for running Processing.py on its own, for
various platforms. Decompress the file, making note of the location of the
resulting directory.</p> <h2 id="the-basics">The basics</h2> <p>Once you've
installed Java and decompressed the <code>processing-py.jar</code> file, put a
copy of the <code>.jar</code> file in a new directory for your project. Now you
can use your favorite text editor to write a Processing.py sketch. Here's a
simple sketch you can use for testing. Copy it and paste as
<code>mouse_follow.py</code>:</p>

<pre><code>def setup():
    size(400, 400)

def draw():
    background(255)
    fill(0)
    ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 50, 50)</code></pre>

<p>Save the file in the same directory as the <code>.jar</code>. Open a command
line session (with, e.g., Terminal on OSX or Command Prompt in Windows) and
<code>cd</code> to the directory with the sketch and the
<code>processing-py.jar</code> file. Now, type the following:</p>

<pre><code>java -jar processing-py.jar mouse_follow.py</code></pre>

<p>The command above runs the Java interpreter (<code>java</code>), and tells
the interpreter to run the code in the given JAR. The
<code>processing-py.jar</code> file contains all of Processing.py along with a
little bit of code that reads and executes the Python file specified on the
command line.</p>

<p>After typing the above and hitting return, you should see a window appear
with the <code>mouse_follow.py</code> sketch up and running. Once you have that
program working, you can run any Processing.py program on the command line
using the same syntax. The <code>examples.py</code> folder contains a number of
example scripts to get you started.</p>

<h3 id="if-something-goes-wrong...">If something goes wrong...</h3>

<p>If the window did not appear, then something went wrong. Make sure that you
typed the command as specified, spaces and all (note that there's a space
between <code>java</code> and <code>-jar</code> and that there's only one
hyphen in the <code>-jar</code> parameter). If your error message says
something like <code>'java' is not a recognized command</code> or <code>java:
command not found</code>, then you may not have successfully installed Java
(see previous section for further instructions).</p>

<p>Any syntax errors or runtime exceptions in your program will be printed to
the terminal.</p>

<h3 id="java-command-line-parameters">Java command-line parameters</h3>

<p>When you run <code>java</code> on the command line, it's up to you to know
which parameters to pass to the interpreter. For most simple applications of
command-line Processing.py, the <code>-jar</code> parameter is probably the
only parameter you'll need, but for more advanced usage you might need to dig a
bit deeper into the possibilities. You can see a full list of parameters by
typing <code>java -help</code>.</p>

<p>The most important parameters for you to know about right from the beginning
are <code>-Xms</code> and <code>-Xmx</code>, which set the initial and maximum
heap size, respectively. Roughly, the heap size is how much memory Java is
allowed to use when running your program. If you're getting errors saying that
you're out of memory, or if Java performance is poor when working with programs
that load large objects into memory repeatedly, it might be worth overriding
the defaults for these values by specifying them on the command line. <a href="https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Troubleshooting#out-of-memory-errors-javalangoutofmemoryerror">All
    of the advice given here in the Java Processing Wiki</a> also applies to
Processing.py; <a href="http://crunchify.com/jvm-tuning-heapsize-stacksize-garbage-collection-fundamental/">here's
    another good starting point for adjusting these values</a>.</p>

<p>For example, to run Processing.py requesting a starting heap size of 256
megabytes and a maximum heap size of 1 gigabyte:</p>

<pre><code>java -Xms256m -Xmx1024m -jar processing-py.jar </code></pre>

<h2 id="included-helper-scripts">Included helper scripts</h2>

<p>The distribution you downloaded comes with a number of "helper
scripts" for running Processing.py on the command line. These are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>processing-py.app</code>: A drag-and-drop application for Mac OS X. You can run this and then drag Processing.py programs from the Finder into the window to run them.</li>
<li><code>processing-py.bat</code>: A Windows batch file that launches a Processing.py program with a splash screen and default Java parameters</li>
<li><code>processing-py.sh</code>: A shell script (for Linux, OS X and Cygwin) that launches a Processing.py program with a splash screen and default Java parameters</li>
</ul>

<p>The benefit of using these programs is that you can launch them directly
from your GUI's filesystem navigator without having to navigate to the
appropriate directory, etc. All of these helper scripts, by default, launch a
sketch called <code>workspace/example.py</code>; you can overwrite this script
with your own code if you'd like.</p>

<h2 id="loading-media-and-other-data">Loading media and other data</h2>

<p>The Processing language supports several functions, like
<code>loadImage()</code>, <code>loadFont()</code>, <code>loadShape()</code>,
etc. that load data from the filesystem. Processing.py supports these functions
as well! In order to use these functions, you need to put the data in a place
where Processing can find it. If you're used to working in the Processing IDE,
you've probably added external data to your sketch using the "Add
file..." menu option. When you're using Processing.py directly from the
command line, you can accomplish the same task by copying files directly.</p>

<p>By default, functions like <code>loadImage()</code> in Processing.py will
look for the given filename in a subdirectory named <code>data</code> located
in the same directory as your sketch. If the file isn't found there, it will
attempt to find the file in the same directory as the sketch itself. For
example, the following statement:</p>

<pre><code>loadImage("test.png")</code></pre>

<p>... will first attempt to load <code>&lt;your sketch
    dir&gt;/data/test.png</code>; if it's not found there, Processing will try
to load <code>&lt;your sketch dir&gt;/test.png</code>.</p>

<p>An additional wrinkle with Processing.py is that Python's built-in
<code>open()</code> function has been modified to follow these same rules. So
the following statement:</p>

<pre><code>open("foo.txt").read()</code></pre>

<p>... will attempt to open a file named <code>foo.txt</code> inside a
<code>data</code> subdirectory as well. (If it can't find the file in the
<code>data</code> subdirectory, it will default to Python's normal behavior of
looking for the file in exactly the path specified.)</p>

<p>Note: For compatibility purposes, and to avoid any unusual behavior when
your sketch is bundled as a standalone library, we recommend keeping your
external media in the <code>data</code> subdirectory.</p>

<h2 id="external-libraries">External libraries</h2>

<p>Just like Python Mode in the Processing IDE, Processing.py on the command
line can make use of third-party libraries.</p>

<h3 id="processing-libraries">Processing libraries</h3>

<p>Processing (the vanilla Java version) has a <a href="http://processing.org/reference/libraries/">rich library of
    third-party contributed libraries</a>. The Processing IDE has a helpful
"Add Library" feature that allows you to locate, download and use
these libraries in your project using a GUI interface. Of course, on the
command line, that option isn't available to you! So here's what you do:</p>

<ul>
<li>Make a subdirectory called 'libraries' in the same directory as your sketch file.</li>
<li>Download the Processing library that you want to use. Depending on the library, it can sometimes be tricky to find the right file to download. <a href="https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/How-to-Install-a-Contributed-Library#manual-install">The Processing Wiki has good advice on how to identify the appropriate file and how to find the relevant files within that repository</a></li>
<li>Extract the library's archive file (usually a ZIP file) and copy the resulting directory into the <code>libraries</code> subdirectory that you just created.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're having trouble locating the right file to download for a
particular library, there's a helpful alternative technique. Use the Processing
IDE's "Add Library" feature to download and install the library for
use in the IDE. Then find the folder where the IDE keeps the libraries you've
downloaded by going to the IDE's Preferences panel and clicking the
"Browse" button next to the "Sketchook Location" field.
Take a look inside the <code>libraries</code> subdirectory and you'll find all
of the Processing libraries that you've added to the IDE. To add any of these
libraries to your Processing.py sketch, simply copy the library's entire
directory Processing.py's <code>libraries</code> subdirectory.</p>

<p>Once you've copied the files to the correct location, use Processing.py's <a href="http://py.processing.org/reference/add_library.html"><code>add_library()</code></a>
function to import the library, putting the name of the library as a string
literal as the parameter to the function call.</p>

<p>For example, to use the <a href="https://processing.org/reference/libraries/sound/">Processing Sound
    library</a>, download the ZIP file from <a href="https://github.com/processing/processing-sound/releases/tag/latest">the
    repository's "releases" page</a>. Unzipping the file should
result in a directory called <code>sound</code>; copy this to the
<code>libraries</code> subdirectory for your sketch. Once the files are in the
right location, put this function call at the top of your sketch:</p>

<pre><code>add_library("sound")</code></pre>

<h3 id="python-code">Python code</h3>

<p>Use the <code>import</code> keyword to use external Python modules in your
sketch. For code that you've written, the <code>import</code> keyword works the
same as it does in vanilla Python: <code>import foo</code> will first attempt
to load the code in <code>foo.py</code> (or a package in a subdirectory named
<code>foo</code>) in the same directory as the sketch, and then will attempt to
load a module with that name from the standard library.</p>

<p>It's important to note that Processing.py uses the pre-packaged Jython
standard library, and (by default) can't see or use any of the Python libraries
in your own system installation of Python. <a href="TK">See this tutorial on
    using Python libraries in Processing.py</a> for more information. Because
Processing.py is built with Jython, it might also be helpful <a href="http://www.jython.org/jythonbook/en/1.0/ModulesPackages.html">to
    consult Jython's documentation on modules and packages</a>.</p>

<h3 id="other-java-libraries">Other Java libraries</h3>

<p>Processing.py is built with Jython, which is built with Java, which means
you can also regular Java libraries in your Processing.py sketches. (This is
true whether you're using Python Mode in the IDE or Processing.py from the
command line.) Just for starters, all of the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/">Java standard API</a> is
available to you; here's a sample sketch that opens a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/">Swing</a>
window:</p>

<pre><code>from javax.swing import JFrame

def setup():
    size(400, 400)
    frame = JFrame("Simple Test", size=(200, 200))
    frame.setVisible(True)

def draw():
    background(0)</code></pre>

<p>Consult the <a href="http://www.jython.org/jythonbook/en/1.0/ModulesPackages.html">Jython
    Book's chapter on modules and packages</a> for more information.</p>

<p>You can also use third-party Java libraries. The easiest way to do this is
to download the library's JAR file and put it in the same directory as your
Processing.py sketch. (The command-line launcher for Processing.py
automatically adds whatever JARs it finds in the sketch's directory to Java's
classpath.) A forthcoming tutorial will show a full example of using a Java
library in a Processing.py sketch.</p>

<h2 id="command-line-parameters-and-environment-variables">Command-line parameters and environment variables</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, the way that the Processing.py command-line launcher is
written makes it impossible to supply extra parameters to your script on the
command line. As a workaround, you can use environment variables. For example,
here's a sketch that reads the environment variables <code>ELLIPSE_SIZE_X</code>
and <code>ELLIPSE_SIZE_Y</code> with Python's <code>os</code> library and uses
them to initialize the size of an ellipse in the sketch:</p>

<pre><code>import os
ellipse_size_x = int(os.environ['ELLIPSE_SIZE_X'])
ellipse_size_y = int(os.environ['ELLIPSE_SIZE_Y'])
def setup():
    size(400, 400)
def draw():
    background(0)
    fill(255)
    ellipse(width/2, height/2, ellipse_size_x, ellipse_size_y)</code></pre>

<p>On the OS X or Linux command line, you can set the environment variables and
run the sketch simultaneously by typing something like this (assuming you've
put the code above in a file named <code>env_params.py</code>):</p>

<pre><code>$ ELLIPSE_SIZE_X=100 ELLIPSE_SIZE_Y=150 java -jar processing-py.jar env_params.py</code></pre>

<h2 id="moving-a-project-from-the-ide-to-the-command-line-and-vice-versa">Moving a project from the IDE to the command line (and vice versa)</h2>

<p>You can run any sketch you create in the Processing IDE on the command line.
To do this, you'll first need to find the directory on your computer where the
sketch files are using the "Show Sketch Folder" option in the
"Sketch" menu of the IDE. Copy the <code>processing-py.jar</code>
file to this directory and then navigate to the directory on the command line.
(In OS X, the easiest way to do this is by typing <code>cd</code> in the
Terminal window, followed by a space, and then dragging the folder from the
Finder to the Terminal window and then hitting "Return.")</p>

<p>After you've done this, run the Java interpreter as you would for any
command-line Processing.py sketch. The filename to supply on the command line
is the main <code>.pyde</code> file of the sketch. So, for example, if your
sketch from the IDE is called <code>wonderful_python_sketch_yay</code> you
might type the following to run the sketch from the command-line:</p>

<pre><code>$ java -jar processing-py.jar wonderful_python_sketch_yay.pyde</code></pre>

<p>If you have an existing Processing.py sketch that you wrote on the command
line, it's possible to "import" it back into the Processing IDE. For
short sketches, the easiest way to do this is probably to just copy and paste
the source code into a new Processing IDE project. For more sophisticated
sketches, you can create a sketch in the format the IDE expects "by
hand" using the following steps:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Rename the main Python file of your sketch to have a <tt>.pyde</tt>
extension.</li>
<li>Make sure that the name of the directory that the <tt>.pyde</tt> file is in
exactly matches the name of the <tt>.pyde</tt> file itself. (E.g., if your
sketch is called <tt>foo.pyde</tt>, the directory it's in should be called
<tt>foo</tt>).</li>
<li>In the Processing IDE, use the <tt>File &gt; Open</tt> menu option and navigate to
the directory with your sketch. Select the <tt>.pyde</tt> file and click
  "Open."</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="building-a-standalone-application">Building a standalone application</h2>

<p>The command-line version of Processing.py has had, in the past, a feature to
create a standalone application bundle. Unfortunately, as of this writing <a href="https://github.com/jdf/processing.py/issues/211">this feature is
    broken</a> on some platforms. For now, the easiest way to create a
stand-alone application with a command-line Processing.py sketch is to import
it into the Processing IDE (as outlined in the previous section) and use Python
Mode's "Export Application" feature, which works just fine.</p>

  <h3>Coordinate Space</h3>

  <p>Before we begin programming with Processing, we must first
  channel our eighth grade selves, pull out a piece of graph paper,
  and draw a line. The shortest distance between two points is a
  good old fashioned line, and this is where we begin, with two
  points on that graph paper.<br>
  <br>
  <img src="imgs/1.1.jpg"><br>
  <br>
  The above figure shows a line between point A (1,0) and point B
  (4,5). If you wanted to direct a friend of yours to draw that
  same line, you would give them a shout and say "draw a line from
  the point one-zero to the point four-five, please." Well, for the
  moment, imagine your friend was a computer and you wanted to
  instruct this digital pal to display that same line on its
  screen. The same command applies (only this time you can skip the
  pleasantries and you will be required to employ a precise
  formatting). Here, the instruction will look like this:<br></p>
  <pre>
line(1,0,4,5)
</pre><br>
  Even without having studied the syntax of writing code, the above
  statement should make a fair amount of sense. We are providing a
  <em>command</em>(which we will refer to as a "function") for the
  machine to follow entitled "line." In addition, we are specifying
  some arguments for how that line should be drawn, from point A
  (1,0) to point B (4,5). If you think of that line of code as a
  sentence, the function is a verb and the arguments are the
  objects of the sentence. The code sentence also ends with a
  semicolon instead of a period.<br>
  <br>
  <img src="imgs/1.2.jpg"><br>
  <br>
  The key here is to realize that the computer screen is nothing
  more than a fancier piece of graph paper. Each pixel of the
  screen is a coordinate - two numbers, an "x" (horizontal) and a
  "y" (vertical) - that determines the location of a point in
  space. And it is our job to specify what shapes and colors should
  appear at these pixel coordinates.<br>
  <br>
  Nevertheless, there is a catch here. The graph paper from eighth
  grade ("Cartesian coordinate system") placed (0,0) in the center
  with the y-axis pointing up and the x-axis pointing to the right
  (in the positive direction, negative down and to the left). The
  coordinate system for pixels in a computer window, however, is
  reversed along the y-axis. (0,0) can be found at the top left
  with the positive direction to the right horizontally and down
  vertically.<br>
  <br>

  <h3>Simple Shapes</h3>

  <p>The vast majority of the programming examples you'll see with
  Processing are visual in nature. These examples, at their core,
  involve drawing shapes and setting pixels. Let's begin by looking
  at four primitive shapes.<br>
  <br>
  <img src="imgs/1.4.jpg"><br>
  <br>
  For each shape, we will ask ourselves what information is
  required to specify the location and size (and later color) of
  that shape and learn how Processing expects to receive that
  information. In each of the diagrams below, we'll assume a window
  with a width of 10 pixels and height of 10 pixels. This isn't
  particularly realistic since when you really start coding you
  will most likely work with much larger windows (10x10 pixels is
  barely a few millimeters of screen space.) Nevertheless for
  demonstration purposes, it is nice to work with smaller numbers
  in order to present the pixels as they might appear on graph
  paper (for now) to better illustrate the inner workings of each
  line of code.<br>
  <br>
  A <a href="http://www.processing.org/reference/point_.html"><strong>point()</strong></a>
  is the easiest of the shapes and a good place to start. To draw a
  point, we only need an x and y coordinate.<br>
  <br>
  <img src="imgs/1.5.jpg"><br>
  <br>
  A <a href="http://www.processing.org/reference/line_.html"><strong>line()</strong></a>
  isn't terribly difficult either and simply requires two points:
  (x1,y1) and (x2,y2):<br>
  <br>
  <img src="imgs/1.6.jpg"><br>
  <br>
  Once we arrive at drawing a <a href="http://www.processing.org/reference/rect_.html"><strong>rect()</strong></a>,
  things become a bit more complicated. In Processing, a rectangle
  is specified by the coordinate for the top left corner of the
  rectangle, as well as its width and height.<br>
  <br>
  <img src="imgs/1.7.jpg"><br>
  <br>
  A second way to draw a rectangle involves specifying the
  centerpoint, along with width and height. If we prefer this
  method, we first indicate that we want to use the "CENTER" mode
  before the instruction for the rectangle itself. Note that
  Processing is case-sensitive.<br>
  <br>
  <img src="imgs/1.8.jpg"><br>
  <br>
  Finally, we can also draw a rectangle with two points (the top
  left corner and the bottom right corner). The mode here is
  "CORNERS".<br>
  <br>
  <img src="imgs/1.9.jpg"><br>
  <br>
  Once we have become comfortable with the concept of drawing a
  rectangle, an <a href="http://www.processing.org/reference/ellipse_.html"><strong>ellipse()</strong></a>
  is a snap. In fact, it is identical to <strong>rect()</strong>
  with the difference being that an ellipse is drawn where the
  bounding box of the rectangle would be. The default mode for
  <em>ellipse()</em> is "CENTER", rather than "CORNER."<br>
  <br>
  <img src="imgs/1.10a.jpg"><br>
  <br>
  <img src="imgs/1.10b.jpg"><br>
  <br>
  <img src="imgs/1.10c.jpg"><br>
  <br>
  It is important to acknowledge that these ellipses do not look
  particularly circular. Processing has a built-in methodology for
  selecting which pixels should be used to create a circular shape.
  Zoomed in like this, we get a bunch of squares in a circle-like
  pattern, but zoomed out on a computer screen, we get a nice round
  ellipse. Processing also gives us the power to develop our own
  algorithms for coloring in individual pixels (in fact, we can
  already imagine how we might do this using "point" over and over
  again), but for now, we are content with allowing the "ellipse"
  statement to do the hard work. (For more about pixels, start
  with: <a href="http://processing.org/reference/pixels.html">the
  pixels reference page</a>, though be warned this is a great deal
  more advanced than this tutorial.)<br>
  <br>
  Now let's look at what some code with shapes in more realistic
  setting, with window dimensions of 200 by 200. Note the use of
  the <a href="http://www.processing.org/reference/size_.html">size()</a>
  function to specify the width and height of the window.<br>
  <br>
  <img src="imgs/1.11.jpg"><br>
  <br></p>
  <pre>
size(200,200)
rectMode(CENTER)
rect(100,100,20,100)
ellipse(100,70,60,60)
ellipse(81,70,16,32) 
ellipse(119,70,16,32) 
line(90,150,80,160)
line(110,150,120,160)
</pre>

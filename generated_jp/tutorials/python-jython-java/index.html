    <p>Processing.py is based on the Java implementation of <a href="http://www.processing.org/">Processing</a>. It makes use of
    <a href="http://www.jython.org/">Jython</a>, an implementation of Python
    that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), to directly access the
    underlying Java library. The benefit of this strategy is that your
    Processing.py sketches can do pretty much anything regular Processing
    sketches can do, and newer versions of Processing.py immediately benefit
    from performance enhancements and new features that are added to the Java
    implementation. When you're making sketches with Processing.py, you have
    access to best of three different software platforms and ecosystems:
    Python, Java, and Processing.</p>

    <p>However, if you're already familar with any of these platforms, you may
    find that some things work in unintuitive way, or fail to work at all. This
    tutorial is designed to help you become literate about how Processing.py,
    Processing, Python and Java all work together, so you can reason better
    about how to diagnose problems and use the full potential of the
    platform.</p>

    <h2>Jython's limitations (and quirks)</h2>

    <p>Jython is an implementation of Python that runs on the Java Virtual
    Machine (JVM). Jython was initially developed as a way to write Python
    programs that make use of existing Java libraries, frameworks and
    infrastructure. Jython is designed to be as compatible as possible
    with all Python programs, and is generally just as fast as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPython">CPython</a> (the
    "reference" implementation of Python, written in C) for most tasks.</p>

    <p>However, Jython does have some significant limitations, especially if
    you're used to working with CPython. For more details, see the <a href="https://wiki.python.org/jython/JythonFaq">official Jython
        FAQ</a>. But here's a rundown of the most important differences for
    users of Processing.py.</p>

    <h3>Python versions</h3>
    
    <p>The latest version of Jython implements Python 2.7. Python 2.7 is still
    widely used, but Python 3 (which has a number of incompatibilities with
    earlier versions) is gaining popularity. If you're new to Python, keep in
    mind that some tutorials and example programs you find on the web will be
    written in Python 3, not Python 2.7, and may require a bit of reworking to
    make them functional in Processing.py.</p>

    <h3>Python Libraries</h3>

    <p>Jython supports almost all of the Python standard
    library (i.e., the libraries that come with Python when you first install
    it). One notable exception is <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/sqlite3.html">sqlite3</a>
    (although you can access SQLite databases using ODBC, and <a href="http://bugs.jython.org/issue1682864">there's an open
        ticket for sqlite3 support in the Jython bug tracker</a>. Jython does
    *not* support third-party Python libraries that use extensions written in
    C. This means that popular Python libraries like <a href="http://www.numpy.org/">numpy</a>, <a href="http://www.scipy.org/">scipy</a> and <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/">scikit-learn</a> <i>will not
        work</i> in Jython (and, for this reason, will not work in
    Processing.py).</p>
    
    <p>Unfortunately, there's no easy way to tell whether or not a
    library uses a C extension (or has a dependency on a library with a C
    extension) without attempting to install it, though there
    are some libraries that ship with a pure-Python fallback if it's impossible
    to compile the C extension.</p>

    <h3>Python and Java don't always see eye to eye</h3>
    
    <p>Java is a statically-typed language, whereas Python is dynamically
    typed. To make the two languages talk to each other, the implementors of
    Jython had to bridge the gap. This can occasionally result in unexpected
    problems when attempting to call Java code from Jython, or when attempting
    to write Jython code that can be called into from Java code.</p>
    
    <p>One notable example is that classes in Jython are defined at
    <em>runtime</em> (unlike pure Java classes, which are usually defined at
    compile-time). This means that a number of features that are important for
    interoperability with Processing libraries, like method introspection, <a href="https://github.com/jdf/processing.py/issues/201">sometimes don't
        work as expected</a>. The <a href="http://www.jython.org/jythonbook/en/1.0/JythonAndJavaIntegration.html">Jython
        and Java Integration chapter</a> from <a href="http://www.jython.org/jythonbook/en/1.0/index.html">The Jython
        Book</a> has a number of good tips and tricks.</p>

    <h2>Gotchas for Python programmers</h2>

    <p>One of the goals of Processing.py is to follow the standard Processing
    API as closely as possible. This means that the functions you might call in
    "vanilla" Processing (i.e., the Java implementation) have exactly the same
    functionality in Processing.py.</p>

    <h3>Conflicting names</h3>

    <p>There are, however, a number of Processing
    functions whose names conflict with existing built-in Python functions. To
    cope with these cases, Processing.py implements special "wrapper" functions
    invoke the appropriate underlying code based on the number of parameters
    passed to the call. Here's a list of some of the affected functions:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><tt>filter()</tt>. In Processing, this function <a href="https://processing.org/reference/filter_.html">applies a filter or
            shader to the pixels in the current frame</a>. In Python, this is
        <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#filter">a
            built-in function that constructs a list by evaluating a function
            on each item of an existing list</a>. Processing.py checks the
        types of the variables passed to the function at runtime and invokes the
        Processing function if the parameters match the appropriate signature,
        and the Python built-in otherwise.</li>
        <li><tt>map()</tt>. In Processing, <a href="https://processing.org/reference/map_.html">map()</a> is one of several functions
        (along with <a href="https://processing.org/reference/lerp_.html">lerp()</a>, <a href="https://processing.org/reference/constrain_.html">constrain()</a>,
        etc.) that help interpolate numerical values between ranges.
        Processing.py's wrapper will invoke the Processing function if the number and type of
        the arguments in the function call matches the signature, and invoke the
        Python built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#map">map()</a> otherwise.
        </li><li><tt>set()</tt>. This Processing function <a href="https://processing.org/reference/set_.html">sets the color of
            a single pixel on the screen or draws an image</a>. In Python, <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#func-set">set()</a>
        creates a new set object or converts an iterable to a set. Again,
        Processing.py's wrapper function invokes either the Processing or
        Python function based on the signature of the arguments passed in the
        original call.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Processing.py makes the core Processing functions available by setting
    attributes of Jython's `__builtins__` object. If you're interested in the
    technical details, <a href="https://github.com/jdf/processing.py/blob/master/runtime/src/jycessing/core.py">the
        built-ins are assigned in core.py</a>, and the "wrapper" functions are
    implemented in <a href="https://github.com/jdf/processing.py/blob/master/runtime/src/jycessing/PAppletJythonDriver.java">PAppletJythonDriver.java</a>.

    </p><h3>Lists and arrays</h3>

    <p>To make things easier on beginner programmers, vanilla Java Processing
    includes a number of functions for easily manipulating arrays 
    such as <tt>split()</tt>, <tt>splitTokens</tt>, <tt>append</tt>,
    <tt>arrayCopy</tt>, <tt>reverse</tt>, etc.). For compatibility purposes,
    Processing.py supports these functions, even though in most cases you would
    want to use Python built-in data structures instead.</p>

    <p>If you do end up using these functions, be aware that they return
    Python <tt>array</tt> objects, not lists. (Jython internally represents
    Java arrays as objects of type <tt>array</tt> from Python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/array.html">array</a> module.)
    For example, consider the following two lines of code:</p>

    <pre>
    print type(split("a,b,c,d", ",")) # Processing built-in, prints <type>
    print type("a,b,c,d".split(",")) # Python string method, prints <type>
    </type></type></pre>

    <p>In most situations, arrays and lists are interchangeable, so you might not
    even notice. But arrays and lists have subtly different functionality,
    which might cause bugs in your program if you're not careful. For
    example, the following code raises a TypeError:</p>

    <pre>
    x = split("a,b,c,d", ",")
    x.append(20)
    </pre>

    <p>... because <tt>split()</tt> returns a strictly-typed array of Java
    String objects, and you can't append an integer to such an array. Likewise,
    lists and arrays don't compare element-wise, as illustrated by the
    following example:</p>

    <pre>
    x = split("a,b,c,d", ",")
    y = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
    print x == y # prints False
    </pre>

    <p>Always keep an eye on the types of your variables and make sure you know
    what you're working with. In addition to the Processing functions mentioned
    above, there may be third-party libraries that you use in your
    Processing.py sketch that return array types as well. Fortunately, there's
    an easy fix: use the Python built-in <tt>list()</tt> function to convert
    the arrays into a list. For example:</p>

    <pre>
    x = list(split("a,b,c,d", ","))
    y = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
    print x == y # prints True
    </pre>

    <p>Note, however, that most vanilla Java Processing function that normally
    takes an array as a parameter will happily accept plain Python lists in
    their stead, though they'll still return an array. So, for example:</p>

    <pre>
    print shorten([1, 2, 3, 4]) # prints array('i', [1, 2, 3])
    </pre>

    <h2>Gotchas for Java/Processing programmers</h2>

    <p>For various reasons, Processing.py's implementation of Processing
    functions differ in small ways from the implementation in vanilla Java
    Processing. For the most part, these differences will be invisible to you
    and the functions should "just work" as expected. Included below are a few
    quirks that might come up.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>As noted in the previous section, Processing.py supports many
        string and array manipulation functions from vanilla Java Processing.
        But it's almost always a better idea to use Python built-in types and
        their methods instead. (The official <a href="https://docs.python.org/2.7/tutorial/index.html">Python
            Tutorial</a> is a good place to start if you want to learn more
        about Python lists, strings and other data structures.)</li>

        <li>Processing.py does not support the <tt>loadTable()</tt> function.
        Use the Python standard library <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html">csv</a> module
        instead. Likewise, use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html">json</a> module
        from the Python standard library for loading, manipulating and saving
        JSON data (instead of, e.g., vanilla Java Processing's
        <tt>loadJSONObject()</tt>), and <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html">elementtree</a>
        for XML data (instead of <tt>loadXML()</tt>).</li>

        <li>Processing.py does not support "web color notation" for specifying
        colors. Instead, enclose the notation in a string literal and pass that
        to the relevant function. (e.g., <tt>fill(#0000FF)</tt> is a syntax
        error, but <tt>fill("#0000FF")</tt> works just fine).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Using Processing Libraries</h2>

    <p>Most Processing libraries work with Processing.py out of the box. In
    Python Mode in the Processing IDE, you can search for and add libraries to
    your sketch using the "Add Tool..." dialog, just like you do with vanilla
    Java Processing. Processing.py adds a global variable
    <tt>this</tt> to your sketch automatically which you can pass to
    third-party libraries that need a reference to the current sketch.</p>

    <p>Some Processing libraries want you to define functions in your sketch with particular
    names and signatures in your sketch as callbacks or event handlers. Right
    now, these libraries won't work in Processing.py unless specific support has been
    added. As of this writing, full or partial support exists for 
    <a href="https://processing.org/reference/libraries/serial/index.html">Serial</a>,
    <a href="https://processing.org/reference/libraries/video/index.html">Video</a>,
    <a href="https://processing.org/reference/libraries/net/index.html">Net</a>
    and <a href="http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/oscp5/">oscP5</a>. If there's a
    library that you'd like to use that isn't yet supported, <a href="https://github.com/jdf/processing.py/issues">open an issue
        here</a>.</p>

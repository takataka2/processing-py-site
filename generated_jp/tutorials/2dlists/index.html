        <p> A <a href="http://py.processing.org/reference/list.html">list</a> keeps track of multiple 
        pieces of information in linear order, or a single dimension. However, the data associated 
        with certain systems (a digital image, a board game, etc.) lives in two dimensions. To 
        visualize this data, we need a multi-dimensional data structure, that is, a multi-dimensional 
        list.

        <br><br>

        A two-dimensional list is really nothing more than an list of lists (a three-dimensional list 
        is a list of lists of lists). Think of your dinner. You could have a one-dimensional list of 
        everything you eat: 

        <br><br></p>

        <em>(lettuce, tomatoes, salad dressing, steak, mashed potatoes, string beans, cake, ice cream, coffee)</em> 
        <br><br>
        <p>
        Or you could have a two-dimensional list of three courses, each containing three things you eat: 
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <em>(lettuce, tomatoes, salad dressing) and (steak, mashed potatoes, string beans) and (cake, ice cream, coffee)</em> 
        <br><br>
        <p>
        In the case of a list, our old-fashioned one-dimensional list looks like this:
        </p>
        <pre>
        myList = [0,1,2,3]
        </pre>     
        <br>
        <p>
        And a two-dimensional list looks like this:
        </p>
        <pre>
        myList = [ [0,1,2,3], [3,2,1,0], [3,5,6,1], [3,8,3,4] ]     
        </pre>
        <br>
        <p>For our purposes, it is better to think of the two-dimensional list as a matrix. A matrix can 
        be thought of as a grid of numbers, arranged in rows and columns, kind of like a bingo board. 
        We might write the two-dimensional list out as follows to illustrate this point: </p>
        <pre>
        myList = [  [0, 1, 2, 3],
                    [3, 2, 1, 0],
                    [3, 5, 6, 1],
                    [3, 8, 3, 4]  ]
        </pre>
        <p>
        <br>
        We can use this type of data structure to encode information about an image. For example, the 
        following grayscale image could be represented by the following list: 
        <br><br>
        </p>
        <img src="imgs/grid.jpg">
        <br><br>
        <pre>
        myList = [  [236, 189, 189,   0],
                    [236,  80, 189, 189],
                    [236,   0, 189,  80],
                    [236, 189, 189,  80]  ]
        </pre>
        <p>
        <br>
        To walk through every element of a one-dimensional list, we use a  for  loop, that is:
        </p>
        <pre> 
        myList = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9];
        for index in len(myList):
          myList[index] = 0 # Set element at "index" to 0. 
  
        </pre>
        <p>
        <br>
        For a two-dimensional list, in order to reference every element, we must use two nested loops. 
        This gives us a counter variable for every column and every row in the matrix.
        </p>
        <pre>
        myList= [ [0, 1, 2]
                  [3, 4, 5]
                  [6, 7, 8] ]

        # Two nested loops allow us to visit every spot in a 2D list.   
        # For every column i, visit every row j.
        for i in len(myList):
          for j in len(myList[0]):
            myList[i][j] = 0

        </pre>
        <p>
        <br>
        For example, we might write a program using a two-dimensional list to draw a grayscale image.
        <br><br>
        </p>
        <img src="imgs/points.jpg">
        <pre>
        # Example: 2D List
        def setup():
            size(200,200)
            nRows = height
            nCols = width
            myList = make2dList(nRows, nCols)
            drawPoints(myList)
            
        def make2dList(nRows, nCols):
            newList = []
            for row in xrange(nRows):
                # give each new row an empty list
                newList.append([])
                for col in xrange(nCols):
                    # Make every column in every row a random int from 0 to 255
                    newList[row].append(int(random(255)))
                    
            return newList

        def drawPoints(pointList):
            for i in xrange(len(pointList)):
                for j in xrange(len(pointList[0])):
                    stroke(pointList[i][j])
                    rect(i,j,10,10)
        </pre>
        <br>
        <p>

      A two-dimensional list can also be used to store objects, which is especially convenient for programming 
      sketches that involve some sort of "grid"  or "board."  The following example displays a grid of Cell 
      objects stored in a two-dimensional list. Each cell is a rectangle whose brightness oscillates from 0-255 
      with a sine function.
